BIO text  ...... 

<h2> Artistic statment</h2>
    I’m interested in the astatic beauty that can be produced in juggling though different patterns
     and sequences, the endless possibilities of different moves and combinations give so much 
     creative freedom. I’m curious about the virtuosity of juggling and enjoy creating 
     and exploring complexity in my juggling. I enjoy how juggling can cause amazement and 
     surprise, revealing unforeseen movement qualities of the objects.
